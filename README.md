rsync-scripts
=============

Here is the basic rsync script -- it's pretty much a one-liner -- plus the exclude file that script uses to keep the backup from taking forever (and wasting space on the backup filesystem).

The goals of moving this code to Github is to help me learn both git and Github -- and possibly also Gitorius.
